OpenCV
======

This is meant to be used as an aid for beginners using OpenCV with Python. The learning curve was very steep and 
quality documentation was not easy to come by. I've attempted to comment my code as much as possible to make it 
easy to follow. I fully recommend using Linux as your OS and also using Willow Garage's API to help understand
what CV functions are capable of and how they are used.
